                    I'm a fulltime Fullstack Engineer for V Shred and oncall as a Fullstack Engineer for Jijenge Academy.
                    I was formerly a Software Engineer Tutor with Trilogy Education Services on campus at UCLA and remote supporting a minimum of 10 students a week in specific technologies within Fullstack Web Development.

                    In March of 2018 I was accepted into Hack Reactor, Los Angeles' 21st cohort. While at Hack Reactor I studied Web Development and gained the skills I use today in my career and met most of my peers within the Los Angeles WebDev community.
